 	<b><i class="fa fa-star"></i> Our plugins</b>
 	<p>The best part about MundoDisco, is that we only use the best plugins, such as McMMO, Factions, and Essentials.
 	We will never use risky plugins that could cause our gameplay to be corrupted, or unfair towards you.
 	We are able to <u>guarantee</u> that our gameplay is fair for everyone, and cannot be bought by real money.
 	AggrothMC is a game that requires a lot of skills to win, or to even participate, and we will do everything we can to keep it that way.

  <div class="tab-pane fade" id="staff">

  	<b><i class="fa fa-legal"></i> Our staff team</b>
  	<p>Our staff team has been carefully chosen, and will never corrupt.
  	We pick the most active and loyal players to moderate the server, to prevent anyone from cheating, and to keep the
  	community as clean as possible. We will never choose anyone unfit for a relevant position, and will listen to the players.
  	If you want to be staff, be sure to never break the rules, and to always keep a clean mind.</p>

  <div class="tab-pane fade" id="community">

  	<b><i class="fa fa-comments"></i> Our community</b>
  	<p>Our community is growing daily, meaning that more and more members will enjoy the server.
  	But this also means that there will be alot of communication between players.
  	This is why we have decided to create an discord channel where you can talk with your fellow players.
  	You will see several voice channels, and several text channels that you can join.
  	Simply click <a href="https://discord.gg/BXawDT6" target="blank">here</a> to join (new tab).</p>
